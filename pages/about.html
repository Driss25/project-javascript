            <p>The Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or
                practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company
                shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to

                available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>
            <p>We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites
                or services that You visit.</p>
            <h1>Termination</h1>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
                whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
            <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
            <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
                suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
                limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased
                anything through the Service.</p>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be
                liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
                limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption,
                for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to
                use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in
                connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of
                the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
            <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
                consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,
                each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
            <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>
            <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and
                defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company,
                on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service
                providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
                respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
                purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
                performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no
                warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your
                requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications,
                systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be
                error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
                representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of
                the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the
                Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any
                information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content,
                or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms,
                malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
                statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
                You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
                greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
            <h1>Governing Law</h1>

                the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or
                international laws.</p>

                informally by contacting the Company.</p>

                government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a &quot;terrorist
                supporting&quot; country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited
                or restricted parties.</p>
            <h1>Severability and Waiver</h1>
            <h2>Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed
                and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
                applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
            <h2>Waiver</h2>
            <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation
                under these Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance
                at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
